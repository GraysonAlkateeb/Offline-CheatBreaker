**__Notes__**
- This beta doesn't have launcher auto updates. (You'll need to download the next beta manually when it will be released).
- To play you'll need to log into your account in the normal MC launcher or you won't be able to use multiplayer on 1.7.10.
- After launching 1.7.10 you'll need to select your account from the ingame account switcher in the top right corner.
- The max RAM amount is set to 2GB.
- Launching will take longer than in our stable launcher because this launcher re-downloads the client on every launch.
- This launcher uses the normal MC folder so all your Offline CheatBreaker 1.7.10 settings, texture packs, worlds and servers won't be transferred.
- This beta is currently only available for Windows.
- To uninstall this launcher you'll need to open the Windows Control Panel, go to `Uninstall a program` and double click `Offline CheatBreaker Beta`.
